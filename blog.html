<h3>Assignment 0</h3>

<p>Some challenges/troubles I encountered while completing this first assignment were learning how to use GitHub and commiting and pushing files. I solved these by looking through the tutorials and trying different things. From this assignment I learned how to use GitHub and how to make a basic html page. The most helpful resource to me for learning html was w3schools.com with examples of how to include different things in html. I used that resource for example to see how to include an image in an html file.</p>
